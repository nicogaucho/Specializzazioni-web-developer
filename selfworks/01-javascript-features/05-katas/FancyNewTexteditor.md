# Fancy New Text editor

your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.
write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.
the numbering starts at 1. the format is: n: string. notice the colon and space in between

Example:

numbering ([]) === []

numbering (["a", "b", "c"]) === ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

```js
const numbering = (arrayString) => {
  // Implement me! :)
}
```
